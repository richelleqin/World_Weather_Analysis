# World_Weather_Analysis
### Overview of the project
The purpose of this analysis is to first using API to extract cities and their weather data and filter the data based on the userâ€™s preferences which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Further, from the list of potential travel destinations, we will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, we will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
